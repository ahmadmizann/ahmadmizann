# ❄️ Ahmad Mizan Nur Haq

**`Digital Craftsman (UX Designer | Almost a Writer)`**

## I Went to School for Computer Science
I decided to learn Computer Science because I wanted to learn how to craft an app from the ideation to the final product. As the story goes, I write articles about what I do and what I learn. I also write about my thoughts on the tech industry. I publish that content on my Medium page "[ahmadmizannh](https://medium.com/@ahmadmizannh)" On presents day, I started to learn about UX Design and I am loving it.

Actively looking for a collaboration on new projects. please feel free to reach out to me.
